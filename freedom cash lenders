freedom cash lenders, Colorado enacted a successful payday lending reform that led to the closure of more than half of payday loan stores over the ensuing five years but also doubled the number of customers served at each remaining stzore. The state required prices to be roughly three times lower than before the law changed, and lenders responded with improved efficiency. As a result, credit remains widely available, but loan payments now consume an average of 4 percent of a borrowerâ€™s paycheck instead of the previous 38 percent. The reforms have saved Colorado borrowers more than $40 million annually.
